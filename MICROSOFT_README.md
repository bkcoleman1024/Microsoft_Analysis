# Microsoft Analysis

**Author**: Bridget Coleman

## Overview

Microsoft is looking to expand into movies. Given the type of company that Microsoft is, in addition to wanting to make a profit, it will need to satisfy shareholders. I chose to analyze the potential movies from a financial aspect. There can be benefits in small and large budget films.

## Business Problem

With so many companies currently in this area, Microsoft is looking for insight on the movies they should produce. Using the data available I will look into the budgets, profits, and return on investment (ROI).

## Data

The data has been collected from well known movie sites such as IMDB (Internet Movie Database), Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB (The Movie Database). The information from these sites provides information from the movie industry as well as user and audience input. The user input is mainly voting.

## Methods

This project focuses on profit and loss and return on investment.  Domestic and worldwide profits were compared.  Movies with the largest profits also had larger budgets.
Domestic and worldwide ROI was also analyzed.  ROI analysis shows that there is potential with smaller budget movies.   


## Results

The movies should be distributed worldwide.  This will give the projects the best chance to make of making a profit or at least breaking even.

The movies with the largest budgets have established franchises and fanbases.  These movies were the most recent Star Wars movies and Avengers movies.

After reviewing the movies with the greatest ROI over the last 5-20 years, movies that can be classified as horror have some of the best returns.  


## Conclusions

There are additional factors that may determine why a movie may or may not do well.

How is the film marketed?

Build off of user feedback. Use this to reach the target audience.
